Build your image

Please run the following in terminal: docker build -t muhaman/kaggle-gpu:latest .

This command is structured as follows:

1. docker build is the command to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile

2. -t muhaman/kaggle-gpu:latest defines the tag (hence -t) of the image, which will be basically the name of the image. As the first part I put my own name muhaman, because Iâ€™m the maintainer of the image, then I gave it a human readable name kaggle-gpu and provided a version number latest.

3. please note the . (dot) at the end of the line. You need to specify the directory where docker build should be looking for a Dockerfile. Therefore . tells docker build to look for the file in the current directory.
